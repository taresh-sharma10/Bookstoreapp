The Clark College Bookstore offers a multitude of services, both online and in store for the convenience of our students and the greater community.
Online Shopping
We offer three distinct services for online shopping:
<h4>Mail Orders -</h4> Shipped directly to your home via UPS.
<h4>Prepaid Pickup - </h4> Order and pay online, then pick up in store.
<h4>Reservations - </h4> Reserve online, then pay and pick up in store.

<h4>Online Comparison Shopping</h4>
Our Price Comparison feature makes it easier than ever for Clark students to get a great deal on textbooks. We show our prices right alongside other online retailers. Choose the lowest price, greatest convenience, or safest bet- then our one-stop-shop makes it easy to checkout from each retailer, saving you valuable time. Please note that the Prepaid Pickup and Reservation services can not be used on other retailers' sites.

<h4>Rentals</h4>
We offer textbook and calculator rentals to help our students save! You can rent in store or on line. All items will indicate a rental price if they qualify to be rented. You can find out more important details and requirements about our rental program here.

<h4>In Store Hold</h4>
Shop now and pay later! Similar to a Reservation, you select your textbooks in the store and we will hold them for you! In Store Holds are held through the last business day before the quarter begins, allowing you the time you need to finalize your educational budget.

<h4>In Store Financial Aid Extended Hold</h4>
Similar to a Reservation or Hold, you select your textbooks and we will hold them for you but with an extended deadline.

This service is only available in the store because students must provide proof of award at the textbook counter to receive an extended Hold pass. You can convert an online reservation or a standard in store Hold to a Financial Aid Extended Hold at any time, but you must do so in person, in the store. If converting, bring your proof of financial aid (award letter) and identification when you visit the store.

<h4>First Day Digital Access</h4>
A convenient and cost saving program developed for students enrolled in courses using digital content. When faculty elect for First Day Digital Access for their courses, it's a win-win! Students have direct access to required digital course materials through Canvas on the first day of the quarter with no additional searching or shopping needed!

<h4>Sell Books at Buybac</h4>
We’ll buy back as many books as we can from our Clark students! This puts money back in the hands of our students, recycles unwanted books, and makes books available for sale at lower prices. This service is provided at the end of each quarter during finals week, so don’t miss out on your chance to turn your unwanted books into cash!

<h4>Sell Books on Peer to Peer</h4>
Peer to Peer is a student textbook exchange tool available on-line for Clark students to sell or swap books. We are happy to host this service free of charge, but be informed; this tool is not monitored and the store is not involved in any way so we can not guarantee what is bought or sold between individuals. As with any person to person site, use caution and take measures to ensure your safety when coordinating an exchange.

<h4>Text Notification Service</h4>
Renting is an important service we make available for our students to help reduce educational expenses. When rentals don’t get returned, replacement charges are costly! To help ensure you meet the rental deadline and avoid additional charges, we’ll text you reminders (message & data rates may apply).

<h4>Bookstore Gift Cards</h4>
We have reloadable gift cards which can be purchased in store or on line. This is a great way to extend support to a loved one or make it more convenient for them to shop without you!

<h4>Beverage Bonus Punch Card</h4>
We have a great deal to reward our loyal customers! When you buy 9 drinks (excludes small water and F'real milkshakes), you get the 10th one free! Stop by the bookstore and start your punch card today!

<h4>Convenient Services</h4>
We offer a number of other convenience services in the store, located on the main campus. You can purchase your Student ID/Bus Pass/Notary/Copies/Faxes/Forever Stamps. Bind your looseleaf textbook or place a Special Order!

<h4>Convenient Items</h4>
Besides textbooks and required course supplies, we also make a variety of other convenient products available so you can get what you need without leaving campus! Categories include sundries, snacks & food items, hot and cold drinks, office & presentation supplies, small electronic & sound accessories, calculators, Clark logo items, backpacks, gifts and much more all in your main campus store!

<h4>Computers & Software<h4></h4></h4>
Whenever available, we provide educationally priced software & computers, in store and online.
